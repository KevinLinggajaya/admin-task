# Admin Task

This is the starting laravel install for the admin task.

## Help to get up and running
- Create a branch from master using your name as the branch name
- Create a database and your .env file based on .env.example
- Remember composer update and npm install
- Run gulp to compile css, js and copy a few fonts

## Requirements
- We require a simple list of rows in the database
- Add new row - simple validation
- Edit row - simple validation
- Delete row - with confirmation

You are free to create routes, controllers, etc.

## Assumptions
- html/css can be very basic but functional
- Responsive design is not required for this task
